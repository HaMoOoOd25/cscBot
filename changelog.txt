**__Houses System__**

I want to introduce you to a new houses system. The server now has 5 houses which are:
- :dark_sunglasses: House of darkness
- :skull_crossbones: House of toxicity
- :fist: House of alpha
- :scorpion:House of scorpions
- :crossed_swords: House of gladiators

You will be able to collect points for your house by being active. The house will get 1 points per minute **for each member**.
The points of the houses will reset along side the members messages points every week at Monday.


**__New commands of the houses__**

.house (View and select the houses)
.tophouses (View the leaderboard of top houses with most points)

**__Other Changes__**

- Changed donate command alias from *give* to *tranfer*
- New give coins commands for Admins and Developer
- Fixed bugs
- Changed few system utils
- Removed busted unnecessary code and logic
